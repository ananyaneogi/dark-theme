## Dark theme for fun! ðŸŽŠ 

    Switching between dark mode and normal mode on a website based on the illuminant light around you.

Made using Ambient Light API to detect the "light level" and switching styles with our simple ol' CSS. 

The API is not enabled by default but can be enabled in Chrome through a flag!
Check [caniuse stats](https://caniuse.com/#feat=ambient-light) for more info.

No extra installation needed, enable the flag in chrome to see how it works ðŸ˜Š
